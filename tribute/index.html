      <p>Unsurprisingly for the era, Nefertiti was fifteen when she married sixteen-year-old Amunhotep IV and assumed the throne as queen consort. In his fifth regnal year, the pharaoh began his religious movement and renamed himself Akhenaten.</p>

      <p>With the foundation of their new monotheistic religion worshipping the sun god Aten, Nefertiti and Akhenaten further separated themselves from the “old reign” of Ancient Egypt and built a new capital city named Amarna.</p>

      <p>Nefertiti was born in 1370 BCE in the Egyptian city of Thebes. Her name in English means “the beautiful woman has come.” When she and her husband Akhenaten initiated the shift in Egypt's religion, Nefertiti adopted the additional name of Neferneferuaten. Altogether, her full name means “beautiful are the beauties of Aten, a beautiful woman has come.” According to surviving images of Nefertiti, she had beauty in spades.</p>
